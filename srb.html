            Hey! Have you faced the color racism as me? If yes. We both are on the same journey. Our emotions are the same. But the treatment of people around us are different. My friend.
            Don‚Äôt think that we are another <span style="color:#ffc93c;"><a href="https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk02y3qQJl989vRe7awDzd1cFi-jdbA%3A1598595400384&ei=SKFIX6aJF7Hfz7sP5rScoAM&q=george+floyd&oq=george&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAxgAMgUIABCxAzIFCC4QsQMyAggAMgUILhCxAzIFCC4QsQMyBQguELEDMgUILhCxAzICCC4yBQguELEDMgUILhCxAzoECAAQRzoECCMQJzoECAAQQzoKCAAQsQMQgwEQQzoICAAQsQMQgwE6BQgAEJECOgcILhCxAxBDUNT8Bli4jwdgrZcHaABwAXgAgAGcAYgBygaSAQMwLjaYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6wAEB&sclient=psy-ab">George Floyd</a></span>. George Floyd was just another victim of racism. Colors do not define your character. But we as an individual, look at the most unnecessary factor, Color.

            In today‚Äôs world, people are so obsessed with white. Being white is important as your caste. Wake Up! Wake Up! My dear friend. Start being kind with your own surroundings. You are the Change.
          </p>

            It might sound ridiculous but just ask yourself. Is it necessary that every human must be white? Hell No. Not every white colored individual is a good one. And not every black colored individual is bad. The wish of every human is to be accepted by one and all for their personality which  they are.
          </p>

            I guess I am boring you with my serious talks. A fun fact is that <span><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=barack+obama&oq=ba&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j46j69i59l2j69i57j69i61j69i60l2.873j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">Barack Obama</a></span> was the first Black President in the USA. Do you think there should be a mention of the term ‚ÄúBlack‚Äù before the word President?  Discrimination applies to the U.S  President as well.

            This article may not be a fun love story of my life. But it is important to acknowledge other humans with respect regardless of any caste or color or any kind of discrimination.
